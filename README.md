### Competition analysis
Currently, the chatbot deployed on changiairport.com is not able to understand human questions effectively where it can \
only understand simple instructions. Therefore, we aim to enhance the user experience by:
1) Intelligent Chatbot: Using Large Language Model so that complex user requests can be understood easily.
2) New features: 
a) Offering travellers a flexible trip planner which assists users in planning. 
b) Setting up a reminder for their trip seamlessly in Google Calendar.
c) Having a visual representation of their current location and weather data for better trip planning.
d) Recommending tourist attractions in Singapore.
