## Introduction
### Problem Statement:
Travelers may be uncertain about their transportation options and the time required to reach Changi Airport from their current location.

### Solution Architecture:

### Legal/Other Aspects: 
We designed this webpage to be a proprietary product where we hope to collaborate with Changi Airport to offer it as a chatbot solutions and potentially expand our collaboration with other international airports.

### Competition analysis
Currently, the chatbot deployed on changiairport.com is not able to understand human questions effectively where it can \
only understand simple instructions. Therefore, we aim to enhance the user experience by:
1) Intelligent Chatbot: Using Large Language Model so that complex user requests can be understood easily.
2) New features: 
a) Offering travellers a flexible trip planner which assists users in planning. 
b) Setting up a reminder for their trip seamlessly in Google Calendar.
c) Having a visual representation of their current location and weather data for better trip planning.
d) Recommending tourist attractions in Singapore.
